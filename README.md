# Glasgow Hackerspace branding

## Style Guide

### Logos

There are two logos, both using the JetBrains Mono regular font.

Use the main logo (including the 'glas hack' text) in which the logo is a main fixture of the design. Use the alternate 'space' logo in other cases where it should demand less attention.

You can add any background to the logo.

### Text

Where other free text is used in branded materials, it should be in the Iosevka typeface.
